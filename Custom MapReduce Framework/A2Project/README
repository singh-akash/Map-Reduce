Description
-----------
The goal of this assignment is to build a distributed data processing framework that emulates Hadoop. 
This code can be executed on AWS EMR or locally.
This code in these directories is SCAJoop, the framework.
You must go to A2Project peer directory to run that MapReduce application on SCAJoop.
The complete instructions are below.

Prerequisites
-------------
These components are required:
- Java 8
- Apache Maven
- AWS CLI
- pdflatex (sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base)

Installation
------------
1) Unzip project file.
2) Open command prompt.
3) Navigate to directory where project files unzipped.
4) Navigate to subdirectory A2Project.
5) Change key and security group in file: cluster_conf
6) You can create your own bucket and upload input, but it will work with no changes to Makefile.
7) $ make run-cloud
	EC2 machines will come up and the job status will display in the shell where make executed.
8) $ make download-output-aws 
9) $ make report  (or skip this step as report is already generated as report.pdf)
